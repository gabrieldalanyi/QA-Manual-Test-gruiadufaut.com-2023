The manual testing of a web-based application was conducted, and any defects found during testing were documented using JIRA. This process involved systematically testing the application's features and functionalities to ensure that they functioned as intended. Any issues or bugs identified were then logged into JIRA, which allowed for efficient tracking, assignment, and management of these defects. By conducting thorough manual testing and utilizing JIRA to document and manage defects, the overall quality and user experience of the web-based application can be improved.
